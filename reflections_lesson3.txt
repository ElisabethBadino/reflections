Reflection 1

Question: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repository would be more safe, because your work would not be lost if something happened to your computer.

Reflection 2

Question: Why might you want to always pull changes manually 
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

As covered earlier, it is a good idea to only make commits between logical changes.
If Git automatically saved all the time, the different versions might be in the middle of writing a function
or something similar that is not complete.

Reflection 3

Question: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are like clones, only they are created directly on the GitHub platform.
Clones are when you copy an entire repository.
A branch is when you make a seperate file off of the master file.
