Reflection 1

Question: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repository would be more safe, because your work would not be lost if something happened to your computer.

Reflection 2

Question: Why might you want to always pull changes manually 
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

As covered earlier, it is a good idea to only make commits between logical changes.
If Git automatically saved all the time, the different versions might be in the middle of writing a function
or something similar that is not complete.
